# Assement
2. Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram. An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.Examples of isograms:
- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old
The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats. You are required to write a javascript function that takes in the word and writes to console ‘Isogram’ if the word is an isogram or ‘Not Isogram’ if the word isn’t an Isogram.
To submit this assignment, create a new github repository and push the code to a master branch.

3. Write a javascript function that takes in an integer and writes to console the equivalent of the number as a string. For example, if the input is 33, the function should write to console ‘Thirty Three’. If the input is 234, the function should write ‘Two hundred thirty three’ to the console. If the input is 1234, the function should write to console ‘One thousand two hundred and thirty four’. To submit this assignment, create a new branch called `word_converter` add the file with the function and push the code to the repository created in 2 above.
